/* A user consumes a certain number of electricity units, and the electricity bill is calculated as follows:

For units ≤ 100: The rate is ₹5 per unit.
For units > 100 and ≤ 300: The rate is ₹7 for the remaining units.
For units > 300: The rate is ₹10 for units above 300.
Additionally, if the total bill amount is ₹1,200 or less, a 10% discount is applied to the bill.

Write a program to compute the total electricity bill based on the given number of units and handles invalid input as well.

Input Format

A single integer n representing the number of electricity units consumed.
Constraints

−10^6 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

Output Format

If the input is invalid, print, "Invalid Input!"
Otherwise, print the total electricity bill after applying the discount, rounded to two decimal places, "The electricity bill is: [amount].""
Sample Input 0

250
Sample Output 0

The electricity bill is: 1550.00.
Sample Input 1

450
Sample Output 1

The electricity bill is: 3400.00.
Sample Input 2

-10
Sample Output 2

Invalid Input!
Sample Input 3

150
Sample Output 3

The electricity bill is: 765.00.       */
